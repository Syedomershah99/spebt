# SAI SC-SPECT MOBO Pipeline — Audit Report

Focused rigor pass on the MIC-critical pipeline before scaling the CNR-in-loop
runs. Covers: correctness bugs, dead/bloated code, missing error handling,
consistency risks. All findings below are either fixed in this pass or flagged
for a decision.

## Test suite added

`tests/test_pipeline.py` — 25 tests, all passing (~5 s runtime).

| Coverage area | Tests |
|---|---|
| `backfill_cnr._find_cnr_npz` matcher (3 fallback layers) | 5 |
| `mobo_agent.is_feasible` aperture-overlap math | 4 |
| `compute_metrics._per_beam_radial_fwhm` projection math | 5 |
| `compute_metrics.compute_ppds` end-to-end on synthetic HDF5 | 4 |
| `compute_cnr._write_cnr_to_csv` row/column update semantics | 5 |
| `compute_metrics.main()` CSV column alignment on append | 2 |

Run with `python3 -m pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -v` from the repo root.

## Fixes applied (ready to push)

### HIGH — correctness

- **`run_mobo_loop.py::patch_manifest_status()` now anchors on `idx`.**
  Previous behaviour patched the last non-empty row regardless of the `idx`
  argument. Worked only because the caller always appended immediately before
  patching, so any interruption between append and patch (e.g. controller
  wall-time kill) could leave the wrong row updated later. Fixed by scanning
  the manifest in reverse for the row whose first column equals `idx`; falls
  back to previous behaviour with a warning if no match.

- **`mobo_agent.py` docstring corrected.** The design vector was still listed
  as `(aperture_diam_mm, n_apertures, scint_radial_thickness_mm, ring_thickness_mm)`
  from an older 3D formulation; actual is `(aperture_diam_mm, n_apertures,
  n_det_ring1, n_det_ring2)`. Also fixed the "all 4 objectives" line to be
  generic (now references `OBJ_COLUMNS`) so future flips don't require another
  docstring edit.

- **`mobo_agent.py` unused import removed.**
  `from gpytorch.mlls.sum_marginal_log_likelihood import SumMarginalLogLikelihood`
  had no callers.

- **`mobo_agent.py` CLI help updated** to list all five objective columns
  including `cnr_mean`.

### MED — clarity / correctness of comments

- **`compute_metrics.py` docstring updated** to list `PPDS` alongside the other
  metrics, with a note that CNR is added by `compute_cnr.py` in a separate
  step (so future readers don't wonder where CNR comes from).

- **`compute_metrics.compute_fwhm_and_asci()` inline comment fixed.** The old
  comment described a wrong 5-column schema for `beam_properties`; the real
  schema (defined in `pymatana/scanner_modeling/beam_property_io.py`) is 11
  columns and column 4 is `FWHM (mm)`. New comment lists all 11 columns.

- **`run_recon_comparison.py` — dead `SPROJ = None` module variable** replaced
  with a comment explaining that `sproj` is auto-detected per PPDF file inside
  `forward_project` / `run_mlem` and cannot be a constant (varies across
  configs when `n_det_ring1/2` differ).

- **`run_recon_comparison.py` — stale phantom fallback path.** The
  auto-detection list only had the old 2-spebt phantom location, which is
  gone after the vscratch recovery. Added the 3-spebt path as the primary
  fallback (kept the 2-spebt entry as a low-priority backup for legacy
  ad-hoc invocations).

- **`run_recon_comparison.py` — "reward hacking" debug print removed.**
  Legacy tag from the JI-vs-CNR sanity-check era; the current message wasn't
  useful in the compare-mode output. Replaced with a cleaner summary using
  the user-supplied labels.

## Flagged for decision (NOT fixed in this pass)

These are not correctness bugs and don't affect the running MOBO loop. Bring
them up if / when time permits.

### `run_mobo_loop.py`

- **`is_job_running()` uses substring match on job IDs.** With 8-digit CCR
  IDs the odds of a false positive are effectively zero, but a strict
  word-boundary check would be more defensible.
- **Sequential q=1 loop wastes wall-time waiting.** By design (each iteration
  is a separate SLURM job). Only worth changing if we want batch acquisition,
  which is a much bigger change.
- **No timeout on `is_job_running` polling loop.** In practice the SLURM
  wall-time kills the child job, which clears squeue. But a hung squeue
  command would freeze the controller silently.

### `mobo_agent.py`

- **Penalty calculation** (`col.min() * 0.5` / `col.max() * 2.0`) is
  sign-fragile. Works because all metrics are strictly positive today.
  Documenting this constraint would be safer than changing the code.
- **`warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=UserWarning)`** globally
  silences ALL UserWarnings from botorch/gpytorch. Some of those flag
  numerical issues in GP fitting. Currently intentional (log noise reduction)
  but worth revisiting if a GP fit ever gives obviously-wrong lengthscales.

### `run_sai_pipeline.sh`

- **`set -uo pipefail` without `-e`** is intentional (the script wants to
  handle failures per-step), but silent-failure risk is real: any Python
  crash in step 3 or step 4 is invisible unless the user tails the `.err`
  file. `write_zero_ji` only covers KNOWN infeasibility, not arbitrary crashes.
- The legacy `write_zero_ji` function name (from the JI compound-metric era)
  is still accurate about what it does but confusing to a new reader.

### `run_recon_comparison.py`

- The `--config {baseline,bo_optimized}` CLI argument is accepted but never
  branches on. Dead arg, safe to remove — but external ad-hoc callers might
  still pass it.

## Legacy files (candidates for archive)

These are on the disk but not on the MIC-critical path. Consider moving to a
`legacy/` subfolder to reduce cognitive load in the `optimization/` directory:

- `bo_agent.py` — old 2D BO agent
- `run_bo_loop.py` — old 2D BO controller
- `analyze_bo_convergence.py` — 2D BO analysis
- `backfill_mpxi.py` — one-off MPXI backfill (all rows now have MPXI)
- `create_4d_csv.py` — one-off migration from 2D to 4D CSV schema
- `cleanup_lhs_results.py` — one-off cleanup
- `generate_configs.py`, `generate_configs_3d.py` — LHS generators, ran once
  at project start

None of these are imported by the live pipeline; removing or archiving them
is purely cosmetic.

---

## What did NOT need changes

- **`compute_cnr.py`** — cleanly written, correctly reuses `run_recon_comparison`
  functions, monkey-patches `N_ITERATIONS` in a try/finally block, handles
  missing PPDFs with an explicit `FileNotFoundError` catch.
- **`backfill_cnr.py`** — the three-layer matcher (exact → prefix-glob →
  design-signature) is exactly right for our naming variance across LHS vs
  MOBO configs; tests confirm all three layers work as advertised.
- **`backfill_ppds.py`** — simple, correct, idempotent. Checkpoints every 10
  rows so a crash doesn't lose work.
- **`submit_mobo.sh`** — small, correct, committed to git so it survives
  vscratch cleanup.
- **`compute_metrics.compute_ppds()`** — verified end-to-end with synthetic
  HDF5 tests. Note the PPDS metric is not currently used as a MOBO objective
  (per Dr. Yao's earlier decision); the computation is kept in place for
  potential future reformulation.
- **`sai_extract_masks.py`, `sai_extract_props.py`, `sai_analyze_asci.py`** —
  thin adapters over the existing `pymatana/ppdf-analysis/beam-analysis`
  library. Small, single-purpose, no issues found.
- **`generate_mph_scanner_circularfov.py`** — geometry generator was already
  reviewed during the SNMMI slide-15 visualization work; nothing critical
  has changed since.

## Verification

All fixes verified against the test suite:

```
$ python3 -m pytest tests/test_pipeline.py -v
...
============================== 25 passed in 4.64s ==============================
```

Same 25 tests pass both before AND after the fixes; no behavioral regressions.

---

## Recommendation for the CNR runs

The pipeline is in a good state to keep the current 4-objective loop running
overnight. When the CNR row count reaches ~35-45 (currently 37, growing at
~1/hour), we can push the 5-objective flip and the reverted `mobo_agent.py` /
`run_mobo_loop.py` edits together with all the audit fixes as one clean commit.
The test suite catches the most likely regression paths (matcher, column
alignment, PPDS math), so future edits have a safety net.

# Fresh-eyes audit — 2 Sep 2026

Re-checked the code and the results that the MIC claims rest on, with no
assumption that earlier passes got it right. Four things changed as a result;
two of them change what we should say to Dr. Yao.

## 1. The headline reproduces exactly

Recomputed from the raw per-seed CNR outputs rather than from any summary:

| design | n seeds | CNR sector-mean | sd |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mobo_0296` (ours) | 5 | 4.7224 | 0.0694 |
| `tmi_reference_000` | 5 | 3.5887 | 0.0553 |

Gap 1.1336, SE 0.0397, t = 28.6, **+31.6%**. Same seeds 0-4 on both sides,
150 ML-EM iterations on both sides, identical `rod_radii_mm`
(0.100-0.225 mm). No numerical code changed between the two evaluations: the
only commits since 1 Aug touching geometry/PPDF/recon/CNR were `9e37419`
(mail settings), `bc68303` (venv path) and `545aa09` (error handling on the
failure branch only). The comparison is like-for-like.

## 2. The head-to-head conclusion was overstated — corrected

Five paired replicates completed, not three. Best CNR per arm:

| rep | 2obj | 5obj | 2obj - 5obj | feasible 2obj / 5obj |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| r0 | 4.7811 | 4.7365 | +0.0446 | 101 / 101 |
| r1 | 4.8599 | 4.7192 | +0.1408 | 75 / 62 |
| r2 | 4.7940 | 4.6887 | +0.1053 | 75 / 70 |
| r4 | 4.7591 | 4.7640 | -0.0049 | 99 / 100 |
| r5 | 4.8233 | 4.8300 | -0.0067 | 99 / 100 |

All five: mean difference +0.056, t = 1.89, 2obj ahead in 3 of 5.
**Restricted to the three replicates with complete data (r0, r4, r5): mean
difference +0.011, t = 0.65, 2obj ahead in 1 of 3.**

The entire apparent two-objective advantage sits in r1 and r2 — the two
replicates that overlapped the crash window, where 25-38% of evaluations were
lost and the five-objective arm lost more of them (62 and 70 feasible against
75 and 75). Once the crashes are excluded the formulations are
indistinguishable. Keep the five-objective set: it costs nothing in CNR and it
is the one that reports the physics trade-offs.

## 3. Cross-run convergence — a stronger result than the headline

Eleven independent searches (10 head-to-head arms + the main campaign), from
different LHS seed sets and under two different objective sets, recover the
same aperture:

| parameter | mean +/- sd | sd as % of searched range |
|---|---|---|
| aperture_diam_mm | 0.287 +/- 0.014 | **1.8%** |
| n_apertures | 186 +/- 25 | 11.8% |
| n_det_ring1 | 499 +/- 62 | 11.5% |
| n_det_ring2 | 821 +/- 145 | 12.2% |
| d2_inner_mm | 382 +/- 34 | 13.6% |
| d3_inner_mm | 489 +/- 65 | 27.9% |

`fwhm_weighted_mean` at those eleven optima spans 0.482-0.487 — under 1%.

Aperture diameter is pinned to ~1.8% of its range; the ring geometry is barely
constrained at all. This answers the obvious reviewer question ("is this a
lucky local optimum?") with reproducibility rather than assertion, and it says
the design lever is the aperture, not the rings.

## 4. The n_det_ring2 headroom test ran and was never read

`ring2_000..007` completed on 12 Aug (8 configs, 16 PPDFs each, full beam
outputs) and the results sat in `results/ring2_seed_out/` **without ever being
merged into `results_summary_mobo.csv`**. Consequences: the optimizer never
trained on them, and nobody read the answer. Holding the `mobo_0296` aperture
fixed and sweeping ring 2 outward:

| n_det_ring2 | d2_inner (mm) | CNR sector-mean |
|---|---|---|
| 964 | 393.2 | 4.476 |
| 1016 | 414.1 | 4.483 |
| 1066 | 435.1 | 4.544 |
| 1116 | 456.1 | 4.485 |
| 1168 | 477.1 | 4.507 |
| 1218 | 498.0 | 4.455 |
| 1268 | 519.0 | 4.277 |
| 1320 | 540.0 | 4.266 |

Flat from 964 to 1218, then falling. **No headroom above the 960 ceiling** —
consistent with finding 3, where the ring parameters are the unconstrained
ones. This also explains why the archive has 104 rows pinned at exactly 960
and none above it: raising the bound opened a region that has nothing in it.

Caveat, unresolved: `ring2_000` is `mobo_0296` with 4 extra ring-2 crystals,
yet it reads 4.476 against `mobo_0296`'s 4.722 +/- 0.069 — about 3 sigma low,
and the whole batch sits ~0.25 below the archive scale. The deterministic
metrics reproduce (`ppds_ring1` identical to 10 significant figures,
`fwhm_weighted_mean` within 0.3%, ASCI within 1.7%), so the geometry and PPDF
path are fine and it is isolated to the CNR step. **Do not merge these 8 rows
into the archive** until this is settled; a 5-seed re-measurement of
`ring2_000` decides it. The within-batch conclusion (no headroom) does not
depend on it, since all 8 ran identically on the same day.

## 5. In-loop CNR is an unseeded single draw

`run_sai_pipeline.sh` calls `compute_cnr.py` without `--seed`, so every
`cnr_sector_mean` in the archive is one irreproducible Poisson realisation
(sigma ~= 0.08). This is deliberate and documented in the docstring, and it is
fine for ranking, but two consequences are worth stating plainly:

- The archive CNR column cannot be reproduced exactly.
- Selecting the maximum over ~100 draws inflates it. Measured directly: for
  all five designs that were re-measured over seeds, the archive value exceeds
  the 5-seed mean (+0.116, +0.038, +0.211, +0.046, +0.107; mean +0.104). Five
  of five positive is the selection effect, not a bug.

The headline is unaffected because both sides use re-measured 5-seed means,
and the reference was never selected on.

## 6. Silent NaN paths closed

Four returns produced NaN with no message — `compute_cnr.py:78`,
`compute_metrics.py:70`, `:214`, `:612`. Both of August's expensive incidents
were NaN appearing without explanation. Each now names its reason. No bare
`except:` and no `fillna` remain anywhere in the optimization package.
Committed as `35b5a2f`; 112 tests pass.

## Bounds check

323 archive rows, no duplicate config names, no partially-NaN rows (52 are
all-NaN, all of them crash-window or legacy 4D seeds). Six rows lie outside
the declared bounds; four are all-NaN legacy `lhs4d_*` seeds, and two
(`mobo_0190`, `mobo_0193`) carry real data at `d3_inner_mm` = 640 against a
bound of 618 — proposed under the earlier wider bound and never re-flagged.
They are GP training points outside the current search box, which is harmless
extrapolation, and neither is near the optimum.

## Open, not resolvable from the files

Whether the SAI baseline (0.4 mm, 180 apertures) was itself the product of the
systematic resolution-variance screening Dr. Yao described. The +31.6% claim
rests on his characterisation of it, and it is the one thing a reviewer will
push on.
