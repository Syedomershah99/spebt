# Evaluate the fresh 6D LHS seed designs shared by both head-to-head arms.
#
# These are evaluated ONCE and then merged into both arms' results files, so the
# two campaigns start from byte-identical training data and the only difference
# between them is what they optimize. Evaluating separately per arm would let
# Poisson noise in the reconstructions differ between the arms and contaminate
# the comparison at its starting point.
#
# Usage:
#   python make_lhs6d_seeds.py --n_seeds 21 --out lhs6d_seeds.csv
#   sbatch --array=0-20%8 submit_lhs6d_seeds.sh
#   python merge_lhs6d_seeds.py           # after all tasks finish
#
# The %8 concurrency cap is deliberate. run_recon reads 16 HDF5 files inside its
# 150-iteration loop, which is 2,400 reads per reconstruction; at higher
# concurrency the I/O contention timed out 15 of 67 tasks in a previous array.
