# 32G was OOM-killed after 4.5 h. The cost is not the point count, as that first
# estimate assumed — it is qLogNEHVI's hypervolume partition, which grows with
# the size of the Pareto front and the objective count. The script now chunks
# candidate scoring and uses approximate partitioning at m=5, which measured
# 0.83 GB peak on a synthetic archive of the same shape.
#
# MEASURED on the real archive (job 25582343): 585 MB RSS mid-run, against the
# 0.83 GB the synthetic probe predicted. The worry that a 46% Pareto front would
# blow past that estimate was wrong — chunking plus approximate partitioning
# bounds the peak regardless of front size. 128G was requested for that run and
# was a ~200x over-correction after the 32G OOM.
# 16G is ~15x the measured peak: enough margin for a larger archive without
# queueing behind a request nothing needs.
