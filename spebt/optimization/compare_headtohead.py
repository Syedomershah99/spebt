"""
Two objectives against five, run live from identical seeds.

The replay (replay_objective_subsets.py) could only ever be suggestive: the
designs it searched were chosen by the five-objective campaign, so a smaller set
winning there was winning on someone else's map. This compares two campaigns
that started from the same 21 fresh 6D designs and differ only in what they
optimise.

Both arms are scored on CNR regardless of what they optimise. That is the point:
CNR is the outcome we care about, and an arm that does not include it as an
objective is still judged by it.

Comparability notes that matter for reading the output:

  - Hypervolume is NOT compared across arms. The two arms have different
    objective spaces, so their hypervolumes are different quantities with
    different units and comparing them would be meaningless.
  - The x axis is evaluations, not wall time. The arms cost very different
    amounts per iteration, which is reported separately and is part of the
    result rather than a confound to remove.
  - Both arms share the same 21 seed designs, so every trajectory starts from
    the same best-so-far value. A gap at iteration 0 would mean the arms were
    not seeded identically and the comparison is invalid.
