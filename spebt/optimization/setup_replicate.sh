# Prepare one PAIRED replicate of the head-to-head experiment.
#
# Why replicates: the first live run gave 2obj 22 evaluations to reach CNR 4.6
# and 5obj 14, which reverses what the replay predicted. Both are single
# trajectories. The replay's own spread was 12 +/- 9 against 26 +/- 18, wide
# enough that one run per arm is close to uninformative. Three paired replicates
# per arm turn a point into a spread.
#
# Why PAIRED: replicate N generates ONE LHS seed set and gives it to BOTH arms,
# so the starting data is blocked out rather than confounded with the objective
# set. Different replicates use different seed sets, so the conclusion does not
# rest on one lucky or unlucky start.
#
# This script only prepares the seeds. It prints the two sbatch lines to run
# once the seed array has finished, because the campaigns cannot start until
# their training data exists.
#
# Usage:
#   ./setup_replicate.sh 1        # prepare replicate 1
#   ./setup_replicate.sh 2
