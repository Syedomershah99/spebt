# Submit the sequential MOBO controller for the SAI SC-SPECT design search.

# The controller (run_mobo_loop.py) reads the manifest to figure out how many
# iterations have already been completed and picks up from there — this script
# is safe to re-submit any time; it will only propose the delta up to
# --max_iters.
#
# Committed to git so it survives vscratch auto-cleanups.

# Sized against qLogNEHVI's hypervolume computation, which scales badly in the
# number of X_baseline points. 96 GB sufficed at 120 training points (58.7 GB
# peak) but OOM-killed at 189. If the training set grows much past ~250 this
# will recur, and the real fix is capping X_baseline rather than the node.

# --max_iters rows, so it's safe to set higher than we plan to run in one go.
# 180 closed out the 4D campaign; 260 gave 80 iterations of 6D search; 300 was
# reached at the point MPXI was corrected (Aug 4). 380 gives ~100 iterations on
# the corrected objective set, where MPXI is windowed+active and maximized.
# The existing 224 designs stay valid as training data: the design-to-metric
# mapping did not change, only which column is read and its sign.
# 420 gives ~100 iterations past the 322 the campaign reached, now that
# n_det_ring2 can exceed 960 and the ring2_* seeds have put training data in
# the newly opened region.
