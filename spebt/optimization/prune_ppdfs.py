Reclaim disk by deleting simulation output for designs we no longer need it for.

Aug 26 2026: /vscratch filled to 100% and every running job died. Pipeline jobs
could not write their output files, so they failed with no logs; controllers
could not write the manifest or their own stderr, so they died with no
traceback. Nothing was wrong with the code. The cluster simply had no bytes
left.

The arithmetic that caused it:

    PPDF files (position_*)        7,959 MB per design   89%
    beam masks and properties        998 MB per design
    ASCI histograms                  110 MB per design
    the metrics we actually keep        77 KB per CAMPAIGN

Six head-to-head arms at 80 designs each is roughly 4.7 TB to produce a few
hundred kilobytes of numbers.

WHY THIS IS A TOOL AND NOT AN AUTOMATIC PIPELINE STEP
-----------------------------------------------------
The obvious fix is for run_sai_pipeline.sh to delete PPDFs once metrics are
computed. That would have been wrong. compute_cnr.py reads PPDFs back out of
the work directory, which is what made the 5-seed repeat study possible, and
that study is where every error bar in the design result came from. Deleting on
write would have silently removed the ability to measure our own uncertainty.

So pruning is deliberate: keep the designs worth re-measuring, drop the rest.

Usage:
  python prune_ppdfs.py --results_dir results --keep_top 10           # dry run
  python prune_ppdfs.py --results_dir results --keep_top 10 --delete
