# One arm of the two-objective vs five-objective head-to-head.
#
# Both arms start from the SAME fresh 6D LHS seeds and differ only in what they
# optimize, which is what the replay could not establish: the replay's candidate
# pool was chosen by the five-objective campaign, so a subset winning there was
# always searching a space something else mapped.
#
# Usage:
#   sbatch submit_mobo_headtohead.sh 2obj
#   sbatch submit_mobo_headtohead.sh 5obj
#
#SBATCH --partition=general-compute
#SBATCH --qos=general-compute
# MEASURED, 4 cores: the 2obj arm used 44 min of CPU across 71 h, the 5obj arm
# 14 h across 72 h. Both spend most of their life asleep waiting on pipeline
# jobs, so 4 cores is generous already.
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
#
# MEASURED peak RSS, same design space and ~100 training points:
#     2obj arm (25671477)   0.98 GB
#     5obj arm (25671478)  49.60 GB      <- 50x, purely from objective count
#
# qLogNEHVI's hypervolume partition is what costs this, and it grows with both
# the objective count and the training-set size. 160G is ~3x the 5obj peak at
# 100 points and leaves room as the archive grows; the main campaign OOM-killed
# at 96G with 189 points and five objectives.
#
# SBATCH directives cannot branch on the arm, so this default is sized for the
# expensive case. When submitting a 2obj arm, override it -- 160G for a job that
# uses 1 GB just queues behind nodes it does not need:
#
#     sbatch --mem=16G submit_mobo_headtohead.sh 2obj 1
#     sbatch           submit_mobo_headtohead.sh 5obj 1
#
#SBATCH --mem=160G
#SBATCH --time=72:00:00
