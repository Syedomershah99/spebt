Is this really a five-objective problem?

After the Jul 2026 objective revision, four of the five correlate strongly with
reconstructed CNR: FWHM -0.93, ASCI@0.45mm +0.80, PPDS ring 1 +0.60. MPXI was
assumed independent on the strength of a ~0.00 correlation against CNR, but that
was measured against pooled cnr_mean on ~100 configs and says nothing about how
MPXI relates to the OTHER four. That raises a question worth answering before
the next campaign: if four objectives largely restate the same thing, the
multi-objective formulation may be doing less work than it appears, and a
smaller set would search the same space with a sharper acquisition signal.

Symptoms already visible: 94 of 208 designs are Pareto-optimal. With five
objectives a point is dominated only if another beats it on all five, which
almost never happens, so the front stops discriminating and design selection
falls back to CNR with the rest as constraints.

This tests the question against the existing archive, with no new simulation:

  1. Correlation structure. Pairwise Spearman between every objective, and the
     effective dimensionality from a PCA of the standardised objective matrix.
  2. Pareto overlap. Which designs are non-dominated under the full set versus
     under smaller subsets. If the five-objective front is mostly the union of
     the two-objective front plus points nothing dominates by accident, the
     extra objectives are not defining trade-offs.
  3. Ranking agreement. Whether a subset would have selected the same top
     designs, which is the question that actually matters for the campaign.

How to read this:
  - If the top CNR designs sit on the front under every subset, the extra
    objectives are not what put them there, and a smaller set would have found
    them too.
  - Compare the number of principal directions carrying 90% of the variance
    against the 5 objectives declared. A gap means the formulation is asking for
    more trade-offs than the physics actually offers. That is not a failure --
    it is worth knowing, because a smaller set gives the acquisition function a
    sharper signal and a front that actually discriminates.
  - Sign matters in the correlation table. It is in maximization space, so a
    NEGATIVE entry is a genuine trade-off between two objectives, and a strongly
    positive one means the pair is largely restating a single quantity.
  - The "no CNR" row is the useful control: if the four proxies alone pick the
    same designs, they are doing their job as cheap stand-ins for an expensive
    reconstruction.
