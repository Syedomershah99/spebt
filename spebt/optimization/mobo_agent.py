Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Agent for SAI SC-SPECT.

5 objectives (all maximized internally via negation where needed):
  1. FWHM          — minimize (negate)
  2. ASCI          — maximize
  3. sensitivity   — maximize
  4. MPXI          — minimize (negate)
  5. CNR           — maximize  (reconstructed contrast-to-noise ratio from
                                the in-loop 150-iter ML-EM run on the hot-rod
                                phantom; computed by compute_cnr.py and
                                appended to each row by run_sai_pipeline.sh
                                step [4/4]. Direct reconstruction quality
                                objective per Dr. Yao's guidance — the four
                                proxy metrics did not always align with
                                CNR in the tested regime.)

(PPDS was evaluated earlier and put on hold — Spearman ρ vs reconstructed
CNR was not positive across 16 validated configurations. The PPDS
computation remains available in compute_metrics.py but is not used as
an objective here.)

Uses ModelListGP (one SingleTaskGP per objective) + qLogNEHVI.

Design vector: (aperture_diam_mm, n_apertures, n_det_ring1, n_det_ring2,

# --- Objective columns (as they appear in the CSV) ---
# Revised Jul 2026 after measuring every metric against CNR across 109 designs.
# Two of the previous five were being MAXIMISED while pulling against image
# quality; both were replaced (Spearman against section-mean CNR in brackets):
#
#   sensitivity_mean (-0.92)  ->  ppds_ring1 (+0.60)
#       Overall sensitivity rewards wide, poorly collimated PPDFs. Per-ring PPDS
#       showed the inner ring is the only one that helps; ring 4 is at -0.82 and
#       is largely re-measuring aperture size.
#   asci_pct (-0.75)          ->  asci_pct_fwhm0p45 (+0.80)
#       Unwindowed ASCI saturates at 100% for 64% of designs and was already
#       maxed before optimization began. Restricting to beams under 0.45 mm
#       de-saturates it completely.
#   cnr_mean                  ->  cnr_sector_mean
#       Equal weight per rod size rather than pooling all hot pixels, which was
#       area-weighted and let the largest rods dominate. Ranks designs almost
#       identically (Spearman 0.999) but is the defensible definition.
#
#   mpxi_mean (min)  ->  mpxi_windowed_active_mean (MAX)   [RY approved Aug 2026]
#       Two separate errors, found together.
#
#       DIRECTION. MPXI was minimized on the assumption that multiplexing costs
#       image quality. Measured on 228 designs, in physical units, the opposite
#       holds: multiplexing correlates +0.29 with CNR, +0.71 with windowed ASCI,
#       and -0.43 with FWHM. More splitting means more angular sampling and
#       narrower stripes. We were minimizing a quantity every measurement says
#       to increase. RY predicted this from the physics before it was measured.
#
#       DEFINITION. The old count included every beam, while windowed ASCI counts
#       only beams under 0.45 mm, so the two were measured over different beam
#       populations. Matching the window and the sensitivity floor strengthens
#       every relationship: +0.84 vs ASCI, +0.47 vs CNR, -0.62 vs FWHM. Also
#       restricting to detectors that see something (blind detectors contributed
#       k=0 to a then-minimized mean) gives +0.91, +0.60, -0.73.
#
#       Note the active-detector fix ALONE makes things worse (+0.71 -> +0.60 vs
#       ASCI): blind detectors carry real information in an unwindowed count,
#       since a design with many of them is a poor design. The two changes are
#       only correct together.
#
#       Consequence: corrected MPXI is no longer independent of the other
#       objectives -- it is now among the most redundant. Better metric, worse
#       fifth objective. See analyze_objective_redundancy.py.
#   fwhm_mean (-0.83)         ->  fwhm_weighted_mean (-0.93)
#       The unweighted mean counted a beam carrying 0.1% of the signal as much
#       as one carrying all of it. Worse, its gap from the sensitivity-filtered
#       mean tracks aperture diameter at -0.69, so it carried an
#       aperture-dependent artifact -- and aperture diameter is itself the
#       strongest CNR predictor. Weighting each width by that beam's sensitivity
#       removes the artifact and predicts CNR better.
# THE definition of the objective set. Other modules import these rather than
# restating them: run_mobo_loop.py and analyze_mobo_convergence.py both used to
