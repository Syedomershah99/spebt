Does MPXI's relationship with ASCI survive a matched FWHM window?

RY, Aug 2026, on the MPXI vs windowed-ASCI correlation: "This is puzzling and
reveals a mismatch. It would be relevant to assess the correlation between
windowed MPXI against windowed ASCI."

He is right that the comparison was mismatched. mpxi_mean counts every beam a
detector sees, including wide poorly-collimated ones. asci_pct_fwhm0p45 counts
only beams narrower than 0.45 mm. Correlating them compares two different beam
populations, so part of the +0.71 could be an artifact of the window rather
than a property of multiplexing.

This recomputes MPXI over the SAME windowed beam set and re-measures. Two
outcomes, both informative:

  - the correlation largely survives  -> it is a physical relationship between
    multiplexing and angular sampling, and the window was not driving it
  - it collapses                      -> the original number was the mismatch,
    and windowed MPXI is the honest quantity to use from here

It also reports the active-detector variant RY approved, which stops blind
detectors (k=0) being averaged into the score.

Correlations are printed in PHYSICAL units, not maximization space. The
max-space convention negates every minimized metric, which made a +0.33 between
measured MPXI and CNR print as -0.33 and read as though more multiplexing hurt
image quality -- the opposite of what the data says.
